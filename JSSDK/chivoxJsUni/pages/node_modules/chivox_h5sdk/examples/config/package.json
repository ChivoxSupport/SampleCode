The most famous river is Thames. It was also my favourite place during my trip. There is a lot of rain in London. There is time difference between London and Beijing. Festivals in London are the same as those in other European countries. I learned a lot about London during the trip.As a middle school student, you should try to stay away from danger as the problem of safety is becoming more and more serious. After watching TV, you should turn it off in time. If you are at home alone, don't open the door for strangers or invite friends that you have made online to your home. While you are at school, running after each other in the class room can be dangerous. At the same time, you should remember to protect yourself while doing sports. Once you are in the street, you must obey traffic rules all the time. For example, never listen to music while riding a bike. Besides, always follow the traffic lights. If all these are kept in mind, you are sure to enjoy a much safer life."
